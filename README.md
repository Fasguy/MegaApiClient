MegaApiClient
=============

This is a fork of gpailler's [MegaApiClient](https://github.com/gpailler/MegaApiClient) library. \
This fork is used for my [Madieter](https://github.com/Fasguy/Madieter) project, to provide a download surface. \
Focus is mainly placed on the download side of things, so upload and management features are not being actively maintained.
